# The Suburban Schemers

**When life shuts the door, pick the lock.**

Welcome to **The Suburban Schemers**, a delightfully desperate web experience inspired by the chaotic energy of movies like "Fun with Dick and Jane". This project showcases a retro-styled landing page for a fictional duo turning suburban boredom into petty larceny, featuring an **AI-powered Scheme Generator** that cooks up foolproof* criminal plots on demand.

> *Results may vary. Prison time possible.*

-   **Responsive Design**: Built with Tailwind CSS to look great on everything from a vintage desktop to a modern smartphone.
-   **Interactive UI**: Smooth animations, hover effects, and a dynamic user experience.

## Tech Stack

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the project running locally on your machine.

### Prerequisites

-   **Node.js** (v18 or higher recommended)
-   **npm** or **yarn**
-   A **Google Gemini API Key** (Get one [here](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey))

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository** (if applicable) or download the source code.
2.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Configuration

1.  Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory of the project.
2.  Add your Gemini API key to the file:
    ```env
    GEMINI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
    ```
    > **Note**: The application is configured in `vite.config.ts` to map `GEMINI_API_KEY` to `process.env.API_KEY` for use in the application.

### Running the App

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or the port shown in your terminal).

```

## How the AI Works

The **Scheme Generator** (`components/SchemeGenerator.tsx`) uses the Google GenAI SDK to communicate with the Gemini model.
1.  It constructs a prompt asking for a "short, hilarious, absurd, and petty criminal scheme" based on the user's inputs.
2.  It sets the tone to be "desperate but harmless, 1970s suburban style".
3.  The response is displayed in a retro-styled card on the UI.
